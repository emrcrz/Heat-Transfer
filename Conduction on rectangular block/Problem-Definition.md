Consider a rectangular block shown in the figure. The thermal properties of the block is stated below.
Thermal conductivity (k) of the block is 1.1 W/mK and density (œÅ) * specific heat constant (c) is 1900 kJ/m3K. There is no heat generation inside the block. The block is subjected to a heat flux (q = 0.2 W/cm2) at a part of the bottom surface and the rest of the bottom wall is isolated.
